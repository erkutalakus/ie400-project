Held file is a .py file for DP Programming. Others are for CPLEXÃ§

There are 16 matrices for IP and DP part.

MATLAB codes are for creating matrices and plotting. If you run MATLAB code it will give 15 .csv file which are for random matrices.
However, you need to open those .csv files in excel and save it as .xls file for CPLEX code and PYTHON code.

Thank you
